# Cybersecurity research project for CSN190 - (Insert Topic Here)
My Name is Abbie Ventour in CSN 190 ASYNC!
I have always been interested in cybersecurity and coding almost my entire life. I hope to one day be an Ethical Hacker or a Cybersecurity Application Officer.
I hope to have my topic up and ready to get started on by this Friday!
